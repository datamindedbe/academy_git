## Exercise 4 - Deal with merge conflicts

In this exercise you will have to figure out how to deal with merge conflicts. The tasks are the following:

1. Open a terminal and position yourself in the root of this folder (`exercise_4`).
2. Merge the existing branch `feature_branch` into the `main` branch
3. Solve the merge conflict that will happen (choose yourself which outcome is legit)
