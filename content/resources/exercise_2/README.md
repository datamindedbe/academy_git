# Dataminded Academy - Introduction to Git
## Exercise 2 - Logs & checkout

In this exercise you will have to use Git version control features. The tasks are the following:

1. Open a terminal and position yourself in the root of this folder (`exercise_2`).
2. Explore the history of the repository to find out how the content of three specific files change over time. To summarize your findings, fill-in the associated table below:

|                                | Commit 1 (earliest) | Commit 2 | Commit 3 (latest) |
|--------------------------------|---------------------|----------|-------------------|
| client.py (TARGET)             |                     |          |                   |
| config.py (API_VERSION_TO_USE) |                     |          |                   |
| VERSION                        |                     |          |                   |
