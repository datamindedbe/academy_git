# Data Minded Academy - Introduction to Git
## Exercise 2 - Logs & checkout

In this exercise you will have to use Git time-machine features. The tasks are the following:

1. Open a terminal and position yourself in the root of this folder (`exercise_2`).
2. Explore the history of the repository to find out about the following questions:

    * What was the value of the `TARGET` parameter in the `client.py` file when the 2nd commit in the history has been created?

    * How did evolve the value of the `API_VERSION_TO_USE` parameter in the `config.py` file between the current state and the previous revision?
