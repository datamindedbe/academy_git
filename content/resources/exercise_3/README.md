## Exercise 3 - Branching and merging

In this exercise you will have to use the Git branching and merging model. The tasks are the following:

1. Open a terminal and position yourself in the root of this folder (`exercise_3`).
2. Create a branch (choose the name yourself)
3. Commit three different changes to the available files (define yourself what the changes will be)
4. Merge your branch into the `master` branch.
